An idea emerged back in the 20th century about a brand new mode of transport involving a magnetic pad to reduce friction. In 2012, when California was all about the California High-Speed Rail project, Elon Musk suggested Hyperloop. We want to show few cases for Hyperloop, which we made in the begining of 2018.
